NTRS Nebula: Zero-Point Optical Encryption

Version 1.0 | Created by CHETHANA ABEYSINGHE

NTRS (Nano-Topographic Radial Steganography) is a revolutionary optical encryption protocol. It replaces traditional text-based keys with Invisible Zero-Point Dots.

🚀 Features

Zero-Point Logic: Wipes data values, stores only coordinates.

Nebula Hash: Custom non-linear chaos math (No AES).

Matrix Stealth: 100% Invisible Alpha-Channel encoding.

Parity Check: Auto-corrects data stream errors.

📦 Installation for Users (Standalone App)

Download NTRS_Nebula.exe from the Releases page.

Run it from your terminal or command prompt.

📦 Installation for Developers (Python Library)

To use NTRS inside your own Python software:

pip install ntrs_nebula


💻 Developer Usage Guide

1. Integrating NTRS into Your Code

Import the library and initialize the engine with a password (seed).

from ntrs.core import NTRS

# Initialize with a strong password
engine = NTRS("MySecurePassword")


2. Encrypting Data (Creating a Key)

Turn a string (like an API Key, License Code, or Secret Message) into an image.

secret_data = "LICENSE-KEY-8822-9911"
output_file = "license_dot.png"

print("Encrypting...")
engine.encode(secret_data, output_file)
print(f"Created {output_file}")


3. Decrypting Data (Reading a Key)

Read the image file back into a string.

input_file = "license_dot.png"

try:
    result = engine.decode(input_file)
    if "Error" in result:
        print(f"Failed: {result}")
    else:
        print(f"Decrypted Data: {result}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


⚙️ Technical Specs

Encryption: NTRS Nebula Hash (Custom Chaos Stream)

Error Correction: Reed-Solomon (Can survive ~20% data corruption)

Signal Separation: Alpha-Channel Dithering (Δ1 value difference)

Resolution: Quantum Limit (1px Matrix)
